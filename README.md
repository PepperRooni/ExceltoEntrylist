# ExceltoEntrylist
Excel Reader to convert spreadsheet to an entrylist

You need a spreadsheet with nothing but driver first names in the first column, last name in second column, and steam Id with an S in third column. 
If planning to mix 2 and 3 driver teams you will need to separate them into separate spreadsheets and put both paths into the program
More improvements will be made. It is made by a very beginner programmer (me) and a friend. Any tips feel free to let me know:)
